# Maze_Complete_Genetic_Algorithm

This is a simple implementation of genetic algorithm in python.

## The game

The goal of this game is to reach the green target dot. 
The population is a set of dots that starts their journey at the bottom of the screen. 
By the power of th GA these dots will be able to avoid obstacles and reach the target dot!

## Results

After about 14 generations the dots get very smart and reach the goal in no time.

Worth mentioning
+ in order to make the dots reach the goal in the fewest moves as possible i limited the dots moves at first and slowly let them more and more moves
+ the settings for the GA can be easily changed by editing the file game_consts.py
+ feel free to add terrain as you wish to see the dots learn a new path :)
